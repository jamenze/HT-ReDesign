# Re-Design of HawkTalk.org
This will be a mock Re-Design of [HawkTalk.org,](https://hawktalk.org/) a local Non-Profit in Georgia.
As a patron of this wonderful charity, I wanted to challenge myself to create a mock re-brand of its website.

## Live Demo
* Coming Soon!

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
* Create wireframes and prototypes for the website.
* Simplify current design.
* Add pages for popular Education or Owl Encounter services that can only be accessed through their Facebook page.
